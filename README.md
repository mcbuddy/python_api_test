# python_api_test

Sample of quick api test script using python, request and python-unittest
Also I add the input parameter just in case you have more than 1 server that need to test

## setup
- Clone this repo
- Install the requirement library using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure you have pip install, also you might need to use virtual-env if you like
- Change the url and all necessary variable based on your need

## Run the script
- You can run the script on the root directory or under /spec directory
- the command is something like this `python spec/first_api_test.py --input=qa` 
- or `python spec/first_api_test.py -i=uat`
